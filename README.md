### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile!

A brief overview of my interests and expertise:

For anyone came here because of my research during my PhD, I'm sorry to inform you that my research email and school email are terminated after I left school. Please contact me through linkedin (this one should be faster) or here. 

- ðŸŒ± Actively learning about GenAI applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about DL-based fault interpretation. I have extensive knowledge on this topic, thanks to a systematic literature review and 4+ years of personal research experience.
